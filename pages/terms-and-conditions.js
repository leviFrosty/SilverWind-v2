        <h2 className="text-xl">Terms of Sale</h2>
        <p>
          By placing an order you are offering to purchase a product on and
          subject to the following terms and conditions. All orders are subject
          to availability and confirmation of the order price. Dispatch times
          may vary according to availability and subject to any delays resulting
          from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be
          responsible. In order to contract with{" "}
          <a href="https://silverwind.store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            https://silverwind.store/
          </a>{" "}
          you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit
          card issued by a bank acceptable to us.{" "}
          <a href="https://silverwind.store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            https://silverwind.store/
          </a>{" "}
          retains the right to refuse any request made by you. If your order is
          accepted we will inform you by email and we will confirm the identity
          of the party which you have contracted with. This will usually be
          <a href="https://silverwind.store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            https://silverwind.store/
          </a>{" "}
          or may in some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a
          third party{" "}
          <a href="https://silverwind.store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            https://silverwind.store/
          </a>{" "}
          is not acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made
          between yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms
          of sale which they supply you. When placing an order you undertake
          that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are
          an authorized user of the credit or debit card used to place your
          order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the
          goods. The cost of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All
          prices advertised are subject to such changes. (a) Our Contract When
          you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail
          confirming receipt of your order: this email will only be an
          acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A
          contract between us will not be formed until we send you confirmation
          by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to
          you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the
          time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed. (b) Pricing
          and Availability Whilst we try and ensure that all details,
          descriptions and prices which appear on this Website are accurate,
          errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods
          which you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as possible
          and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct
          price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat
          the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for
          the goods, you will receive a full refund. Delivery costs will be
          charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed
          where applicable and included in the &apos;Total Cost&apos;. (c)
          Payment Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard
          authorization check on your payment card to ensure there are
          sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Your card will be debited
          upon authorisation being received. The monies received upon the
          debiting of your card shall be treated as a deposit against the value
          of the goods you wish to purchase. Once the goods have been despatched
          and you have been sent a confirmation email the monies paid as a
          deposit shall be used as consideration for the value of goods you have
          purchased as listed in the confirmation email.
